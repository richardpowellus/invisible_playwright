# Why automating login is riskier than reusing a session

**Automating a login form is riskier than reusing a session because the login form is
the single most heavily monitored flow on most sites, and reusing a saved session avoids
that flow entirely.** The catch is that a reused session only holds if the browser
fingerprint still matches the one that created it.

A script that fills a username, types a password and clicks submit looks like the
obvious way to get an automated session logged in. It is also, on most sites, the
single most heavily instrumented sequence of actions a visitor can perform - the exact
place account-takeover and credential-stuffing defenses concentrate, because that is
where they matter most for the site.

This page explains why that flow draws the most scrutiny, how session reuse skips it,
and the one condition - fingerprint consistency - that decides whether a reused session
keeps working.

## Automating the login form vs reusing a session: which is safer

Reusing a saved session is safer on most sites, because it never runs the login form -
the flow where abuse defenses are strongest - and instead starts already authenticated,
the way a returning visitor does. Automating the form can work, but it runs directly
into the site's most aggressive checks.

| | Automate the login form | Reuse a saved session |
|---|---|---|
| What runs | Username, password, submit: the most monitored flow | No login flow; the session starts authenticated |
| Scrutiny | Highest on the site | Same as any returning visitor |
| Main dependency | Human-like timing, focus order, pointer motion | Fingerprint matching the session's original |
| Fails when | Any automation signal is caught at the form | The fingerprint or exit country changes |

## Why the login flow specifically gets more scrutiny than the rest of the site

Most pages on a site are read by anyone. A login form is different: it is the one
place where getting it wrong has a direct cost to the operator, so it is where fraud
and abuse defenses get the most investment, updated the most often, and tuned the most
aggressively. A page that flags automation loosely everywhere else often flags it
tightly at the one form that asks for credentials.

That means every automation-detectable signal on this site - the timing between
keystrokes, whether the pointer travelled to the field or teleported, whether a field
was focused before it was filled, the rhythm between filling the form and submitting
it - gets checked hardest at exactly the moment a login script runs it.

## When a fresh login is necessary

When a fresh login is needed, bind credential fills to the saved website's
origin rather than checking `page.url` and then typing:

```python
page.get_by_label("Password").fill(
    password, expect_origin="https://example.com", expect_input_type="password"
)
```

`expect_origin` is available on `Page.fill`, `Frame.fill`, `Locator.fill` and
`ElementHandle.fill`, in both sync and async APIs. It must be a serialized
origin: lowercase scheme and host, an optional non-default port, and no
credentials, path (not even `/`), query or fragment. Invalid input raises
`ValueError`.

Both the target document's URL origin and its security origin must match,
including inside a cross-origin iframe, independently of the top-level page's
origin. Opaque security origins are refused: an iframe or CSP sandbox without
`allow-same-origin` cannot receive the value even when its URL matches.
The utility world checks the resolved element immediately before and after
`Page.setUserInput`. It must stay connected to the same document, at the same
origin, with the same node name and input type. This path does not focus, select,
scroll, type keys, or construct events.

For passwords, also pass `expect_input_type="password"`. This requires an
`<input>` whose type matches before and after the native write, so a field that
changed to `text` before the pre-check is refused without writing.
Type names are case-insensitive. The option is available on the same four fill
surfaces in both APIs, requires `expect_origin`, and raises `ValueError` for an
unknown HTML input type name. Known but non-fillable types remain non-fillable;
textarea and contenteditable targets cannot satisfy an input-type expectation.
Omitting `expect_input_type` adds no type expectation.

No-write refusals include `expect_origin=` and `nothing was written`. If a
transport failure leaves the write outcome unknown, the error says so instead
of claiming that nothing was written. Credential fill errors omit the supplied
value. Contenteditable targets are not supported in this mode.

For a changed, unfocused password field, Firefox itself fires trusted
`beforeinput` and `input` as `InputEvent` with
`inputType="insertReplacementText"`, then `change`, without a focus change.
This is the native path used by Firefox's password manager. An already-focused
field defers `change` until blur; an unchanged value produces no events.
Omitting the option keeps ordinary fill behavior.

This is a fork-only API. Since upstream 0.30.0 moved the Juggler client into
`invisible_core`, the guard lives in `_juggler/_credential_fill.py`, using
the core's public selector, actionability and utility-world call APIs.
Only resolution and actionability can retry; a guard refusal or native commit
attempt never restarts the fill. Ordinary fills still use the core's `Actions`.

**This is not an atomic security boundary.** An ordinary document navigation
does not replace that document synchronously during one browser task, but the
checks and commit are separate protocol calls: navigation can occur between
them. A `beforeinput` handler can synchronously change the input type before
the value is committed. If the post-check detects a changed type, document,
origin or connection, or cannot complete, the guard attempts to clear the same
element through `Page.setUserInput` with an empty string. It then raises
`write outcome unknown`, never `nothing was written`, even if clearing succeeds.
If clearing fails, cannot be verified, or a listener repopulates the field, the
error explicitly says so. A lost commit reply takes this same failure path.

Clearing cannot undo disclosure: page listeners can already have observed or
submitted the credential, and a type changed and restored between checks is
not detected. This guard does not protect against hostile scripts on the
expected origin. Use it only when that origin and its scripts are trusted.

## The alternative: don't run the flow at all

Playwright's [`storage_state`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-storage-state)
captures cookies and local storage from a context and can load them into a new one.
Log in once, by hand or through a session you trust,
[save and reuse that state](save-reuse-login-storage-state-playwright.md), and every
subsequent automated session starts already authenticated - no username field, no
password field, no submit click, and none of the scrutiny attached to that specific
sequence.

```python
# once, from a session that actually logged in
context.storage_state(path="session.json")

# every run after that
context = browser.new_context(storage_state="session.json")
```

This is not a workaround. It is the same mechanism a real returning visitor uses:
nobody who logged into a site yesterday retypes their password today, they carry a
session cookie that says who they already are. An automated session doing the same
thing is not imitating unusual behaviour, it is doing what every session that isn't a
first-time login already does.

## The condition this depends on, and it is not optional

A session was created by a specific browser, on a specific machine, presenting a
specific fingerprint at the moment of login. Replaying that session's cookies from a
different fingerprint is asking a site to believe that the same identity suddenly
changed its GPU, its font list, its canvas output and its TLS handshake between one
request and the next - which is exactly the kind of cross-session inconsistency
[a detector is built to catch](timezone-proxy-mismatch.md), regardless of whether the
cookie itself is genuinely valid.

Sites that bind a session to more than a cookie - checking the fingerprint against
what was recorded at login, not just validating the token - will flag or invalidate a
replayed session on a mismatched machine even though the credential is real. The
cookie proves who logged in. It does not, on its own, prove the request came from the
same browser that did.

The practical requirement follows directly: the fingerprint has to stay the same
across the login and every session that reuses it. [A profile tied to one seed](persistent-profiles.md)
is what makes that possible - the identity that logged in and the identity replaying
the cookie later are the same one, not two that happen to share a token.

## What to actually do

1. **Log in once**, through a session using the exact identity - seed, profile, proxy
   country - you intend to keep using.
2. **Save `storage_state` immediately after**, while the session is fresh.
3. **Reuse it from a context built with the same identity**, not a fresh or different
   one. The cookie and the fingerprint are a pair; only one half being right is not
   enough.
4. **Treat expiry as certain, not exceptional.** Sessions end. Build the re-login path
   once, using the same identity, rather than improvising it the first time a saved
   session stops working.

## Short answers to the questions that lead here

**Is it safe to automate a login form at all?** It works, and it is the highest-scrutiny
sequence on most sites. If a session can be captured and reused instead, that avoids
the scrutiny rather than trying to survive it.

**Does a valid session cookie guarantee I won't be flagged?** No. A cookie proves a
credential. Some sites separately check whether the fingerprint replaying it matches
the one that created it, and a mismatch there is checked independently of whether the
token itself is genuine.

**Can I use one saved session across different machines or proxies?** Not safely if
the fingerprint or exit country changes. The session and the identity that created it
are a pair for exactly the same reason [a proxy and a timezone have to agree](timezone-proxy-mismatch.md).

**What happens when the saved session expires?** The automation needs a real
re-authentication path, through the same identity that created the original session,
not a different one improvised under pressure.
