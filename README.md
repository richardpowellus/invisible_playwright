## How it works

Anti-bots ask two questions, and reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha and Cloudflare Turnstile score the answers. invisible_playwright answers yes to both.

**1. Is this a real browser?** Yes. It is Firefox, patched at the C++ source level.

- The browser fingerprint is set inside the engine, not injected into the page: navigator, screen, GPU/WebGL, canvas, fonts, audio, WebRTC, timezone, network. Headless or headed, the same values either way.
- No JS shim, no override, no seam to read.

**2. Is a real person using it?** Yes. The actions are humanized in the driver.

- Every click, hover and drag follows a natural mouse path with human timing, no teleporting cursor.
- Each input is byte-identical to a real mouse: real input source, pressure, trusted events.

## Install

```bash
pip install invisible-playwright
python -m invisible_playwright fetch      # one-time download, sha256-verified: 240 MB (Windows) / 262 MB (Linux x86_64) / 253 MB (Linux arm64), about 550 MB unpacked
```

Requires **Python 3.11 or newer**.

Supported platforms: **Windows x86_64**, **Linux x86_64 / arm64**.

---

## Usage
### Random fingerprint per session
**Playwright's API, sync and async, with no code changes.** The same objects, the same calls, the same return values. A few surfaces are out of scope - tracing, HAR, CDP, the API request context - and each one refuses with a sentence saying why rather than misbehaving quietly. If you already use Playwright, switching is two lines:

```diff
- from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
- with sync_playwright() as p:
-     browser = p.firefox.launch()
+ from invisible_playwright import InvisiblePlaywright
+ with InvisiblePlaywright() as browser:
```

Every session gets a distinct fingerprint (GPU, audio, fonts, screen, ~200 fields) and Bezier-curve mouse motion.

**Sync**
```python
from invisible_playwright import InvisiblePlaywright

with InvisiblePlaywright(proxy={"server": "socks5://...", "username": "u", "password": "p"}) as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
    page.click("#submit")   # mouse arcs to the button on a Bezier curve
```

**Async**
```python
from invisible_playwright.async_api import InvisiblePlaywright

async with InvisiblePlaywright(proxy={"server": "socks5://...", "username": "u", "password": "p"}) as browser:
    page = await browser.new_page()
    await page.goto("https://example.com")
    await page.click("#submit")
```

The `browser` object is a `playwright.sync_api.Browser` / `playwright.async_api.Browser` - every Playwright method works as-is.

Log the seed to replay a run:

```python
sf = InvisiblePlaywright()
with sf as browser:
    print("seed =", sf.seed)
    # ...
```

### Reproducible fingerprint

```python
with InvisiblePlaywright(seed=42) as browser:
    ...   # same GPU, same canvas hash, same audio context, every run
```

### Proxies

```python
proxy = {
    "server": "socks5://gate.example.com:1080",
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass",
}
with InvisiblePlaywright(proxy=proxy) as browser:
    ...
```

Schemes supported: `socks5`, `socks4`, `http`, `https`. DNS is routed through the proxy by default, no local leak.

### Timezone

The browser timezone follows `timezone=`:

```python
# default: timezone is auto-derived from the egress IP (proxy egress if a
# proxy is set, otherwise the host's own public IP)
with InvisiblePlaywright(proxy=proxy) as browser:
    ...

# explicit IANA zone always wins, the only way to force a specific zone
with InvisiblePlaywright(proxy=proxy, timezone="America/New_York") as browser:
    ...
```

### Pinning specific fingerprint fields

By default everything comes from `seed`. To force specific values while the rest stays seed-derived:

```python
with InvisiblePlaywright(
    seed=42,
    pin={
        "gpu.renderer": "ANGLE (AMD, Radeon R9 200 Series Direct3D11 vs_5_0 ps_5_0, D3D11)",
        "gpu.vendor":   "Google Inc. (AMD)",
        "screen.width":  2560,
        "screen.height": 1440,
        "hardware.concurrency": 16,
    },
) as browser:
    ...
```

A GPU pin picks one of the validated personas rather than setting a free string,
because the ~81 `getParameter` values and the extension list travel with the
renderer name and a detector cross-checks them against it. A name the pool does
not carry raises, and the error lists the ones it does.

Full list of pinnable keys, how pinning interacts with the Bayesian sampler, and common patterns are in **[docs/pinning.md](docs/pinning.md)**.

## CLI

The installed command is `invisible-playwright`, with a hyphen. `python -m
invisible_playwright` works identically and needs nothing on PATH.

```bash
invisible-playwright fetch    # download the engine if missing, check every cached
                              # one against the seal, print the path
invisible-playwright version  # wrapper, core and engine versions, and where the
                              # engine is cached
```

## Documentation, guides and comparisons

**If you would rather prompt than script.** This page is the engine, as a Python
library. Two ways to use it without writing code, both one line: from an MCP client
you already have (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor),
`claude mcp add stealth -- uvx aihawk`, see
[the MCP server page](https://github.com/feder-cr/AIHawk/wiki/mcp-server); or with an
interface and a model included, needing only an OpenRouter key,
`uvx aihawk ui --openrouter-key sk-or-...`, see
[AIHawk](https://github.com/feder-cr/AIHawk). Same engine underneath, and the second
is a client of the first.

All of it reads better, and is searchable, in
**[the wiki](https://github.com/feder-cr/invisible_playwright/wiki)**,
organised into four sections instead of one flat list:

- **[Documentation](docs/documentation.md)** -
  installation, the two-line switch from plain Playwright, proxy/timezone
  configuration, pinning specific fields, the CLI.
- **[Guides](docs/guides.md)** - how
  detection actually works, in seven groups: browser identity, canvas/WebGL/fonts/
  audio, network and WebRTC, the automation layer, AI agents, the detectors themselves
  explained from source, and testing.
- **[Comparisons](docs/comparisons.md)** -
  against Camoufox, Patchright, nodriver and playwright-stealth, and the case for
  Firefox over Chromium generally.
- **[Integrations](docs/integrations/)** -
  Scrapy, Crawlee, Robot Framework, CodeceptJS, test runners, Playwright MCP, and the
  frameworks it does not fit, by name.

If you don't know where to start: [Three ways to make Playwright undetected](docs/playwright-stealth-levels.md)
is the map most other pages link back to, [Playwright detected as a bot on one site](docs/playwright-detected-as-bot.md)
is the troubleshooting order, and [navigator.webdriver is not the tell you think it is](docs/navigator-webdriver-explained.md)
explains the most famous property in this space and why patching it alone buys you
almost nothing.

The detectors section now covers the commercial anti-bot products by name, each
read from its own documentation or from confirmed reverse engineering:
[Cloudflare Bot Management](docs/cloudflare-bot-management-explained.md) and
[Turnstile](docs/cloudflare-turnstile-explained.md),
[DataDome](docs/datadome-explained.md), [Kasada](docs/kasada-explained.md),
[Akamai Bot Manager](docs/akamai-bot-manager-explained.md),
[PerimeterX](docs/perimeterx-explained.md), [hCaptcha](docs/hcaptcha-explained.md),
[Imperva](docs/imperva-incapsula-explained.md), and
[the rest of the set](docs/guides-detectors-explained.md).

## Related projects

**The other pieces of this one.** The engine is the middle of three, and the
two around it are how most people reach it:

- **[invisible_core](https://github.com/feder-cr/invisible_core)** - seed to
  fingerprint to preferences, plus proxy and geolocation. This package pins it.
- **[AIHawk](https://github.com/feder-cr/AIHawk)** - this engine as an MCP
  server (`uvx aihawk`, for any client that brings its own
  model) and, in the same package, an interface with a model included, from
  one command. The interface is a client of the server, with no private path
  to the browser.

**The open-source neighbours.** Which one fits depends on the layer your problem is
at, and on whether you need Firefox or Chromium:
[three ways to make Playwright undetected](docs/playwright-stealth-levels.md) works
through what each layer can reach, and [AI browser agents and stealth](docs/ai-browser-agents-stealth.md)
covers the frameworks that pick Chromium over CDP for you.

## What is patched in the engine

Two rules hold across everything below. Every value is decided **before a page can
ask**, inside the browser, so there is no JavaScript shim to find. And every value
comes from **one profile**, so no two surfaces contradict each other, which is how a
spoofed browser is usually caught. Source:
[feder-cr/firefox_antidetect_patch](https://github.com/feder-cr/firefox_antidetect_patch).

**Identity**
- `navigator`, the user agent and the client hints are derived together, so they cannot disagree: [does Playwright set navigator.webdriver](docs/does-playwright-set-navigator-webdriver.md), [client hints and Sec-Fetch](docs/client-hints-sec-fetch.md).
- `navigator.languages` and the `Accept-Language` header are the same declaration, sent and read: [Accept-Language and navigator.languages](docs/accept-language-navigator-languages.md).
- Screen geometry, `devicePixelRatio` and the media queries exposing it are declared, not read from the host: [devicePixelRatio and the Firefox pref](docs/devicepixelratio-firefox-pref.md), [CSS media query fingerprinting](docs/css-media-query-fingerprinting.md).

**Rendering**
- Canvas readback is deterministic per seed and keeps the real shape, rather than blocked or noised: [canvas fingerprint noise](docs/canvas-fingerprint-noise.md), [why a canvas fingerprint changes every run](docs/canvas-fingerprint-changes-every-run.md).
- WebGL reports a coherent GPU persona: vendor, renderer and the parameter limits are cross-checked, not set one at a time: [WebGL renderer strings](docs/webgl-renderer-strings.md), [WebGL parameters are identical](docs/webgl-parameters-are-identical.md).
- Fonts ship with the browser, so the same faces exist on every host and the platform font engine no longer chooses: [bundled fonts across platforms](docs/bundled-fonts-cross-platform.md), [why headless browsers render different fonts](docs/headless-fonts-differ.md), [detecting installed fonts from JavaScript](docs/detect-installed-fonts-javascript.md).
- Text metrics follow those fonts: `measureText` returns ten-plus numbers from one call, with no permission prompt: [measureText and TextMetrics](docs/measuretext-textmetrics-fingerprinting.md).
- Canvas and WebGL agree across operating systems for the same seed: [cross-platform consistency](docs/canvas-webgl-cross-platform-consistency.md), [canvas differs across operating systems](docs/canvas-differs-across-operating-systems.md).

**Audio and media**
- The audio stack answers from the profile rather than from the host device: [AudioContext fingerprinting](docs/audiocontext-fingerprinting.md), [sample rate and latency](docs/audiocontext-samplerate-latency-fingerprint.md).
- The codec table is declared, so a Linux host does not answer a Windows question with Linux support: [codec fingerprinting](docs/codec-fingerprinting.md).

**Network**
- WebRTC offers one synthetic candidate carrying the proxy exit, instead of leaking the real address or offering none, which is itself a tell: [WebRTC ICE candidate spoofing](docs/webrtc-ice-candidate-spoofing.md), [does the WebRTC IP match the proxy exit](docs/webrtc-ip-match-proxy-exit.md).
- DNS resolves through the proxy, including when the proxy is not in the preferences: [does a proxy leak DNS](docs/does-a-proxy-leak-dns-doh-explained.md), [how to check for a proxy IP leak](docs/how-to-check-proxy-ip-leak.md).
- The timezone comes from the egress IP, resolved offline, so it matches the exit: [timezone and proxy mismatch](docs/timezone-proxy-mismatch.md), [offline GeoIP timezone](docs/offline-geoip-timezone-proxy.md).

**The automation layer**
- Input events come from the real input path, so `isTrusted` is true because it is true: [Playwright clicks and isTrusted](docs/playwright-clicks-istrusted.md).
- The pointer follows a human path and timing, at a cadence a real device could produce: [human mouse movement](docs/human-mouse-movement.md), [mouse dynamics as behavioural biometrics](docs/mouse-dynamics-behavioural-biometrics.md).
- The debugger surface does not answer the timing questions that give a driven browser away: [debugger timing detection](docs/debugger-timing-detection.md).
- Closed-mode shadow roots are reachable, which stock Playwright cannot do in either engine, while the page still reads `null`: [closed shadow roots](docs/closed-shadow-root-playwright.md).
