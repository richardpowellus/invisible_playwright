"""Macro-scale pointer behaviour planning (pure, no I/O, no browser).

WHY THIS LAYER EXISTS
---------------------
How a single move from A to B is *shaped* is only half of what a pointer
stream shows. The other half is what the pointer does between the moves,
and where the moves end:

  * a pointer that is perfectly still except for the second it takes to
    slide from one control to the next is still, measurably, a pointer
    that exists only in order to click. Measured on the current path, the
    cursor is motionless for ~96% of a session;
  * if every movement terminates on a clickable element then the SET OF
    ENDPOINTS is itself a signature, and no amount of per-path polish
    removes it. A human parks the cursor on empty page area, drags it out
    of the text being read, and fidgets while a page scrolls.

So the interesting statistics here are not "is this curve pretty" but
"how often does the pointer move at all", "how long are the silences",
"where do the movements end" and "does the shape of all of that differ
between two sessions".

DESIGN: PLAN, DO NOT PERFORM
----------------------------
Every function below is pure: it takes a seed and geometry and returns a
timeline of :class:`Step` objects. Something else - the caller - walks
that timeline and dispatches it. Nothing here imports Playwright, opens a
socket or reads a clock. That is what makes the behaviour testable with
plain arithmetic instead of a live page, and it is why the numbers in the
tests are assertions rather than screenshots.

The walker is ``_cursor``: it turns a timeline into pointer events against
absolute deadlines. What is planned here and what actually reaches the wire
therefore differ, and deliberately so - see ``_cursor`` for the rule that
decides which planned events survive a machine that cannot deliver them all.

DESIGN: THIS MODULE PLANS *WHERE AND WHEN*, NOT *HOW A STROKE IS SHAPED*
------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two scales, and exactly one owner each. ``_motion`` owns the shape
and the pacing of a single stroke from A to B. This module owns everything
above that: how many strokes an action is made of, where they aim, how long
the hand waits between them, and what it does when it is not aiming at
anything.

The seam is the ``render`` argument threaded through every planner below. It
takes a start, an end and a kind, and returns the steps of that one stroke.
It is REQUIRED, not defaulted. This module used to carry its own stroke model
as a fallback, which meant two intra-move laws could ship in one package and a
detector would see a different one depending on which call site ran. That model
was deleted on 2026-07-26 and the seam made mandatory, so a call site that
forgets the renderer is a TypeError rather than a silent second law. ``_cursor``
injects one backed by ``_motion``, and it is the only stroke model in force
everywhere. Two stroke models running side by side in one product would be
two measurably different families of movement inside one session.

DESIGN: EVERY PARAMETER COMES FROM THE SESSION SEED
---------------------------------------------------
Pause length, drift amplitude, pointing speed, where the speed peak sits,
how readily the hand overshoots, how often it moves for no reason: all of
it is drawn per session from the seed (:class:`PointerPersona`). A number
compiled into the package is the same number in every install and every
account, and a fixed shape is an invariant across every session of every
user - which is exactly the property a behavioural classifier wants. Two
seeds must look like two people; one seed must reproduce exactly.

PROVENANCE OF THE NUMBERS
-------------------------
Each constant below carries a comment saying where it comes from. Two
labels are used and they are not interchangeable:

  ``[lit]``   grounded in the human motor-control / HCI literature
              (Fitts' law and its Shannon form; the Meyer et al. 1988
              optimised-submovement account of overshoot-and-correct;
              Flash & Hogan 1985 minimum-jerk velocity profiles; the
              8-12 Hz physiological tremor band; heavy-tailed, roughly
              log-normal dwell times in reading and browsing).
  ``[judg]``  chosen by judgement. Plausible, bounded, and deliberately
              randomised per session so that being wrong about the centre
              of a range costs less - but not measured. Do not quote a
              ``[judg]`` number as if it were evidence.

# whole session from a task script known in advance. It was deleted rather than
# wired, because nothing can call it: this package is driven one action at a
# time by somebody else's script, and the future of that script is not
# knowable when the first action arrives. Composition therefore belongs to the
# dispatcher, which does it incrementally - it is the thing that knows how much
# wall clock really elapsed between two actions, which is the input the
# composition actually needs. The tests keep a local composer for the
# whole-session statistics, where a fixed script is legitimate.
