"""Session logic shared by the sync and async entry points.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. There are two `InvisiblePlaywright` classes, and the only
thing keeping them equal was somebody remembering. Measured 2026-07-27: 203 of
252 normalised lines of `async_api.py` also appear in `launcher.py` - 80.6% -
and `__init__`, `_teardown`, `_build_env` and `_default_context_kwargs` are 100%
identical once the word `await` is deleted. So the duplication is not the price
of async; async was the excuse for it.

That is a defect GENERATOR, and it has already produced three:

  * the 0.4.0 process-leak fix reached the sync class only, and shipped to the
    other half of the users under a release note saying it was fixed;
  * `INVPW_TRUE_HEADLESS`, a documented env var, worked on the async API alone;
  * `_build_prefs` was a method on one side and twenty inline lines on the other.

Anything here must stay free of Playwright imports: it is the part that has
nothing to do with which API a caller picked. What legitimately differs between
the two classes is `await`, and nothing else belongs in this file.

#: ⛔ THE REASON THIS USED TO BE A WORKAROUND IS NOW KNOWN, AND FIXED. This
#: comment said: "the default headful+cloak path intermittently hangs
#: launch_persistent_context on Windows (~40%, a window/compositor race with a
#: persistent profile); true headless ... is reliable". It had the right
#: neighbourhood - window and compositor - and no mechanism, so it stood as an
#: escape hatch for months.
#:
#: The mechanism, measured 2026-08-14: Windows declared the chrome window FULLY
#: OCCLUDED and in the hanging runs the verdict was never revoked
#: (`nsWindow::NotifyOcclusionState() mIsFullyOccluded 1` with no later 0). An
#: inactive BrowsingContext never paints, so delayed startup never finishes,
#: `browser-delayed-startup-finished` never fires, no target is created and the
#: launch times out at 180 s. True headless was reliable for a reason nobody had
#: named: there is no window to occlude.
#:
#: Fixed by `widget.windows.window_occlusion_tracking.enabled=false`, applied to
#: EVERY session by invisible_core - 24 relaunches out of 24 against 6 hangs in 9.
#: So this variable is no longer a workaround for that hang; it remains as a
#: deliberate choice of a different rendering path. Full account:

        written twice, identically, and the WebRTC pair is a contract with the
        binary, so two landing sites meant two chances to miss a change.

        The token stamp stays here because it is the only genuinely per-session
        part: children inherit the environment, so every process in the tree
        carries it and teardown can find its own tree and only its own.
