# ⛔ `_NEWTAB_SETTLE = 0.4` AND ITS WRAPPER AROUND `ctx.new_page` USED TO BE
# HERE, REMOVED 2026-08-23 BECAUSE THE CAUSE WAS CLOSED IN THE ENGINE.
#
# They waited 0.4s after every new tab so the first `goto()` would not get
# hijacked by an internal navigation to `about:newtab`. That navigation was
# not the browser's: it was the PREALLOCATED browser of the new tab grabbing
# the page's channel, because `JugglerFrameParent` identified the target by
# comparing `browserId` against a BrowsingContext's `id` - two different
# counters, which collided. The fix lives there (`juggler/
# JugglerFrameParent.sys.mjs`, the rebuttal with the `<browser>` element), and
# `70-known-bugs.md` [B166] carries the numbers.
#
# Keeping the wait here too would have been a second truth about the same
# fact: the delay had nothing to do with the cause and did not cover it -
# measured the same day, with the wait and without the fix `goto` still died
# anyway, 0 times out of 9 successful. With the fix and no wait at all: 10 out
# of 10.


# The window chrome is NOT a wrapper constant either, for the same reason the
# taskbar below stopped being one, and for one more: the 14 was WRONG. Measured
# against stock Firefox 151 on 2026-08-09, a real browser answers
# outerWidth - innerWidth = 0 and outerHeight - innerHeight = 85; we answered 14
# and 91, identically on both platforms, because a value invented once agrees
# with itself forever and no cross-check can see it. The declaration lives in
# the core as Profile.screen.chrome_w / chrome_h, pinnable like every other
# surface. These names survive only because async_api imports them.

# The taskbar is NOT a wrapper constant. It was one, at 40, while the core
# declared 48 and the engine's compiled floor was 48 - so the viewport was
# derived from one number and screen.availHeight from another, which is a
# disagreement a page can read off two properties of the same window. It is a
# field of the profile now (ScreenProfile.taskbar_px), pinnable like any other,
# and the use sites below read it from there. This name survives only because
# async_api imports it, and it resolves to the same declaration.

# The IANA -> POSIX TZ table moved to `_session` on 2026-07-27, so the async
# class no longer has to import it FROM the sync module. Re-exported under the
# original names because tests and `async_api` import them from here.

        Args:
            seed: Integer seed driving the Bayesian fingerprint sampler.
                Same seed → same fingerprint. ``None`` = fresh random.
            pin: Force specific fingerprint fields (see docs/pinning.md).
            headless: When ``True``, browser renders on a hidden virtual
                display (Xvfb on Linux, ``CreateDesktop`` on Windows) so
                Firefox stays in *headed* mode (real rendering pipeline,
                coherent fingerprint) without showing windows.
            proxy: ``{"server": "...", "username": "...", "password": "..."}``.
                ``socks5://`` / ``socks4://`` go through the patched
                ``nsProtocolProxyService``; ``http(s)://`` go through
                Playwright's own ``proxy=`` kwarg.
            extra_args: Extra command-line args forwarded to Firefox.
            humanize: Move the pointer along a curved, paced path instead of
                teleporting it. Applies to ``page.click`` / ``page.hover`` /
                ``locator.click`` / ``page.mouse.move`` and the rest of the
                ordinary Playwright pointer API - there is nothing new to
                call. Default ``True`` (~1.5 s cap per movement); ``False``
                disables; a float caps a movement in seconds. The path is
                drawn from ``seed``, so the same seed replays the same motion.
                Set ``INVPW_CURSOR_ENGINE=binary`` to go back to letting the
                browser draw it, or ``=off`` to disable motion process-wide.
            locale: BCP-47 tag (e.g. ``"en-US"``) or ``"auto"`` (default).
                ``"auto"`` derives the locale from the egress country - the proxy
                egress IP, or the host's public IP without a proxy - exactly like
                ``timezone="auto"``, keeping the browser language consistent with the
                exit country (a French proxy → ``fr``). invisible_core makes the
                decision (``prepare_session_geo``) and turns the tag into the
                language list Firefox's own table gives it; every value reads
                that list: ``navigator.language``/``languages``, the locale
                prefs, the default context's locale and the q-valued
                ``Accept-Language`` header. A region with no Firefox build of
                its own reports the list's first entry everywhere (an
                Australian egress gives ``en-US, en``, so ``en-US``).
            timezone: IANA zone (e.g. ``"America/New_York"``) - used as-is
                when set, the only way to force a specific zone. ``""``
                (default) or ``"auto"`` ALWAYS resolves from the egress IP:
                through the proxy when one is set, otherwise from the host's
                own public IP (one lookup + an offline mmdb). On failure: with
                a proxy it raises (a foreign proxy on the host TZ is the
                ``timezone_mismatch`` signal); without a proxy it falls back to
                the host TZ so a transient lookup failure can't break launch.
            extra_prefs: Optional dict of Firefox prefs overlayed on top
                of the generated profile - useful for niche tweaks
                without monkey-patching the package.
            profile_dir: Path to a persistent Firefox profile directory.
                When set, the session uses ``launch_persistent_context()``
                so cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, extensions, cache
                and prefs are kept on disk between runs. ``__enter__``
                returns a ``BrowserContext`` (not a ``Browser``) - use it
                directly: ``with InvisiblePlaywright(profile_dir=p) as ctx:
                page = ctx.new_page()``. First run creates the dir;
                subsequent runs reuse it. Pair with a stable ``seed=`` to
                also pin the fingerprint identity across runs.
            show_cursor: Draw the pointer where the automation is, so a
                person watching the screen can follow the session - the
                Windows arrow, with the package logo's green halo around it.
                Default ``None``, meaning "not specified": the value is
                decided once, by ``invisible_core.prefs.DEFAULT_SHOW_CURSOR``,
                and today that is on. Pass ``False`` to draw nothing. What
                makes it safe either way is that it is drawn in the BROWSER'S
                OWN chrome window, which the page
                cannot reach - it is absent from ``page.screenshot()``,
                invisible to ``document.elementFromPoint``, and not a DOM
                node any site can enumerate. So it changes nothing a
                detector sees, and everything a PERSON sees: a dot gliding
                across a window with nobody touching the mouse reads as
                "this is a bot" to anyone glancing at the monitor. It is a
                demo and debugging switch, not a stealth one.

        kwargs still override.

        BOTH, because ``new_page`` does not go through the patched
        ``new_context``. Playwright's sync ``Browser.new_page`` forwards to the
        IMPLEMENTATION object, whose own ``new_page`` calls ``self.new_context``
        - itself, the impl - so a wrapper installed on the sync-api object is
        never consulted. Read on the installed Playwright, and it is the call in
        this package's own README and docstring: ``browser.new_page()`` was
        opening a page with Playwright's stock 1280x720 viewport, the host's
        colour scheme and no locale or timezone override, against a fingerprint
        claiming the profile's screen. A viewport that contradicts
        ``screen.width`` is not a missing feature, it is an inconsistency, which
        is the one thing this package exists to avoid.

        Written through the public ``new_page`` rather than by reaching into the
        impl: that keeps Playwright's own ownership wiring (closing the page
        closes the context it owns) instead of reimplementing it against private
