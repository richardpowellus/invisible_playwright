"""The Python side of the Playwright protocol, backed by Juggler.

⛔ EVERY SHAPE IN THIS FILE WAS MEASURED, NOT DEDUCED. `scripts/capture_protocol.py`
records a real session against the Node driver, and the initializers, the object
parentage, the event names and the ordering below come from that recording. The
difference matters: reading `_impl` tells you which initializer fields are
CONSUMED today, and the fields a future code path will want are exactly the ones
that reading cannot show you.

**WHAT THE RECORDING SAID, and some of it is not what you would guess:**

- `goto`, `click`, `fill`, `title`, `content` and `querySelector` are sent to
  the **Frame**, not the Page. The Page owns almost nothing.
- `mouseMove` IS sent to the Page - and in a humanised session it arrives
  nineteen times for one click, because the cursor travels.
- `BrowserContext` is created with three children already alive - `Debugger`,
  `Tracing`, `APIRequestContext` - and each is announced BEFORE the context that
  names it, then re-parented with `__adopt__`.
- A `Frame` is created before its `Page` and adopted afterwards, so the Page
  initializer can point at a `mainFrame` that already exists.

**THE ORDER IS THE PROTOCOL.** `Connection.dispatch` looks a guid up in a plain
dict and raises `Cannot find object` when it is missing, so a `__create__` that
arrives after the message naming it is not a race that usually works: it is a
hard failure. Everything here creates first and returns the channel second.

        NEVER SUCCEED. [B184]: the engine's handler calls
        `unsafeObject.scrollRectIntoViewIfNeeded`, and that method is not
        declared in ANY binding of `Element` in the tree - not a `.webidl`, not
        a `.idl`, not `Bindings.conf` - so it is `undefined` for every caller
        and the `else` branch always throws. Measured on the shipped binary at
        four positions, including an element ALREADY IN VIEW: timeout every
        time, while `bounding_box()` on the same element answered correctly.

        ⛔ AND THE REMEDY WAS ALREADY IN THIS FILE'S REACH, which is the part
        worth knowing. `Actions` scrolls before every click through
        `InjectedScript.scroll_into_view` - native `scrollIntoView` reached from
        the utility world, `block: "center"` - and has done since a click below
        the fold was found to miss. So the click path scrolled correctly while
        the public method sent a command that cannot work. One concept, two
        implementations, and the broken one was the one users call.

        Reusing that helper rather than writing a second one is the whole fix:
        no new abstraction, and the two paths cannot drift.

        ⛔ `rect` IS NOT HONOURED, and saying so is better than pretending.
        Playwright can ask to scroll a sub-rectangle of the element; the helper
        scrolls the element. No caller in this package passes it, and a partial
        answer that looks total is worse than a named limit.
