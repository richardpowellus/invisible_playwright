"""The retry loop, and the actions that run inside it.

⛔ THIS IS THE PIECE THAT FAILS SILENTLY, and the reason is the shape of the
loop: if a condition is checked ONCE and then acted on, the page can change
between the check and the action. It doesn't break: it breaks ONE TIME IN
TWENTY, when loading is slower than usual.

THE RIGHT SHAPE, and every line of this file exists to keep it:

    until it expires:
        RESOLVE THE SELECTOR FROM SCRATCH   <- don't reuse the old handle
        ask whether it is actionable
        get the point
        act
        if something says "it's not there anymore": START OVER

⛔ **The selector is resolved on EVERY turn.** Reusing the previous turn's
handle is the mistake that makes the loop pointless: if the DOM has changed,
that handle points to a detached node, and the action goes nowhere without
saying anything.

⛔ **And a timeout must say WHY.** A bare `TimeoutError` on a retry loop is
the least useful thing you can print: the reason for the last turn - "missing
visible", "the selector finds nothing", "no quad" - is the only information
that tells you what to look at.

        """Approach, check that the point still belongs to the element, and
        only then do the thing that cannot be taken back.

        ⛔ `force` SKIPS THE CHECK, AND THAT IS NOT AN EXEMPTION - IT IS WHAT
        THE OPTION MEANS. "Receives events" is one of the actionability checks
        `force` is documented to bypass, and an overlay intercepting the
        pointer is the ordinary reason somebody passes it. Honouring `force`
        on the state checks alone would leave it half wired, which is the
        defect this was: an option accepted on every public signature that
        changed nothing a caller could observe.

        ⛔ IT USED TO BE AN INTERCEPTOR, and that history is why the shape here
        matters. An interceptor watched each event WHILE it arrived and BLOCKED
        the ones whose point had stopped belonging to the element. It needed
        capture listeners for the duration of every action, and the block
        itself was a tell: a real `mousedown` that vanishes under
        `preventDefault` is not something any input stack produces.

        It was replaced by two pure DOM reads, one before the action and one
        after, and the one AFTER is what this corrects.

        ⛔ A CHECK AFTER THE EVENT CANNOT ANSWER THE QUESTION IT IS ASKED, AND
        IT DROVE A RETRY. Once the event has gone out, these two are the SAME
        observation:

            the point stopped belonging to the element BEFORE the event, so the
            click landed on something else;

            the point stopped belonging to the element BECAUSE of the event, so
            the click landed exactly where it was aimed and the control did
            what it exists to do.

        The second is not an edge case, it is most controls. Measured on the
        published 0.22.0, one `browser_click` per call: a button that hides
        itself on click received THIRTY-NINE clicks and the call then reported
        failure; a panel toggle was opened and closed by a single call, which
        reported success; a button that only moves, and one that does nothing,
        were correct thirty times out of thirty. The discriminant is not
        movement - it is the target ceasing to be hittable BY ITS OWN EFFECT.

        A check whose negative result carries no information cannot gate
        anything, so it is gone rather than narrowed. What it leaves behind is
        the invariant `_retry` depends on: starting over is sound only while
        nothing has happened, and every raise here is now before `commit`.

        ⛔ AND THE READ MOVED AFTER `approach`, WHICH IS WHERE THE RACE IS. It
        used to run before the pointer moved, so a page that rearranges itself
        on hover - a menu opening under the cursor is the ordinary case - was
        judged in the layout that existed before the thing that changed it.
        What is left is one round trip between this read and the press. Closing
        that one belongs to the engine, the only place that can verify and
        dispatch without a gap; it is not closed by reading the DOM again
        afterwards, which is what this function just stopped doing.

        Measured by `tests/gates/injected_page_surface.js`: the bundle touches
        the page's window zero times, in every phase.

        ⛔ AND WHAT CLOSES THE GAP IS NOT A THIRD READ OF THE GEOMETRY. It is
        the engine telling us where each event LANDED, recorded at dispatch by
        a privileged listener the page cannot see (`Page.pointerLanded`). That
        answer distinguishes what a read after the fact cannot: an event that
        hit the element and then saw it move away by its own effect landed ON
        the element, and says so. `lands` names the events the commit emits -
        the press and the release for a click, the one move for a hover - and
        every one of them must have landed on the element or inside it, which
        is also the condition under which the DOM composes a `click`. A miss
        raises `ActionMissed`, which `_retry` does not catch: something has
        happened, and the invariant this loop rests on is that it starts over
        only while nothing has.

        `force` skips this as it skips the check before: the caller has said
        the event is to go wherever the pointer is, and an overlay receiving it
        is then not a miss but the request. [B217]
