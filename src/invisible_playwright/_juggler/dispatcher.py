"""Protocol objects: guids, parentage, `__create__`, and method routing.

This is the other half of `transport.py`. The transport moves messages; this
decides what answers them.

**THE MODEL, WHICH IS SMALLER THAN IT LOOKS.** The Playwright protocol is not
RPC on a flat namespace: every message names a `guid`, and that guid is an
OBJECT with a type, a parent and an initializer. The client mirrors that tree
locally - `Connection._objects` - and builds a `ChannelOwner` for each one the
moment it sees a `__create__`. So a server that answers correctly has to do
three things and only three:

1. Hand out guids and remember what each one is.
2. Announce every new object with `__create__` BEFORE anything names it,
   parented to an object the client already knows.
3. Route `{guid, method, params}` to the object that owns it.

⛔ **ORDER IS PART OF THE PROTOCOL, NOT AN OPTIMISATION.** `__create__` for a
child must reach the client before the reply that returns a channel to it, and
before any event fired on it. `Connection.dispatch` looks the guid up in a plain
dict and raises `Cannot find object` if it is not there yet - so an out-of-order
create is not a race that usually works, it is a hard failure. Everything that
creates an object therefore emits the create first and returns the channel
after, in that order, from the same thread.

⛔ **AND A CHANNEL IS `{"guid": ...}`, NOT THE OBJECT.** `_connection.py`
replaces guids with channels on the way in and channels with guids on the way
out. A server that returns a bare guid string where a channel is expected does
not fail at the seam: the client stores a string where a `ChannelOwner` should
be, and the failure surfaces later, in a property access far from the cause.
