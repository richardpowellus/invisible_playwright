"""Wiring that routes pointer movement through the wrapper's own generator.

WHY THE MOTION IS GENERATED HERE AND NOT IN THE BROWSER
-------------------------------------------------------
Until now every ``mousemove`` was expanded inside the browser, by code that
ships with the binary.  That has three consequences we want to be rid of:

* The trajectory is built from compiled-in constants, so its shape is an
  invariant across every session of every install.  Generated here it derives
  from the session seed instead, which means two users - and two sessions of
  the same user - do not move the same way, and a replayed seed replays the
  cursor exactly like it replays the fingerprint.
* The expansion happened *inside* the browser's own mouse-dispatch entry
  point, which is what breaks hover (see HOVER, below).
* Changing anything about it required rebuilding and re-releasing a browser.

Nothing is lost by moving it.  The in-browser expansion dispatched its
waypoints with exactly the same arguments the ordinary ``mouse.move`` path
uses - same pressure, same input source, same pointer id, same synthesized
flags - so a waypoint driven from here is indistinguishable from one the
binary used to generate itself.

HOW IT REACHES ``page.click`` WITHOUT A NEW API
-----------------------------------------------
This package's promise is that it *is* Playwright: same objects, same
methods, no rewrite.  A ``page.move_like_a_human()`` helper would break that
promise - it only helps code that was written after we shipped it, and every
existing script keeps teleporting.  So there is no new API.  Instead we wrap
the *one* internal funnel every pointer action already goes through.

In Playwright's Python bindings, ``Page.click``, ``Frame.click`` and
``Locator.click`` all end up in the same coroutine on the implementation
object (``Frame._click``); ``hover`` / ``dblclick`` / ``tap`` / ``check`` /
``uncheck`` funnel the same way, and ``Page.set_checked`` funnels into
``check`` / ``uncheck``.  Wrapping those six coroutines therefore covers the
public surface for the sync API *and* the async API at once, because the sync
API is a greenlet driver over the very same implementation objects.  User code
that already says ``page.click("#buy")`` gets the motion with no edit.
``Mouse.move`` and ``Mouse.wheel`` are wrapped for the same reason.

The wrappers are installed on the class, once per process, but they are inert
unless the page belongs to a session that asked for them: the lookup is a
weak-keyed registry, and a page from a plain ``sync_playwright()`` browser in
the same process finds nothing and is delegated to untouched.

HOVER
-----
The in-browser expansion ran *inside* the mouse-dispatch entry point, i.e.
after the automation layer had already installed its hit-target interceptor
for this action.  The interceptor's job is to confirm that the point being
clicked really lands on the element it was told to click.  It sees the first
event of the action, and the first event of the action was the first waypoint
of the curve, which sits far away from the target - usually over ``<html>``.
The interceptor concludes the element is covered by another element and the
action fails.  On Windows that is roughly three hover calls in four.

Generating here fixes it by construction, not by tuning: the whole approach
runs to completion *before* we call the original coroutine, so the interceptor
is installed after the cursor has already arrived.  The only event it sees is
the single, exact move the automation layer makes itself, onto the point it
computed.  There is no waypoint left inside the checked window for it to
mistake for an obstruction.

THE THREE LAYERS, AND WHO OWNS WHAT
------------------------------------
``_motion``     the shape and the pacing of ONE stroke, A to B.
``_behaviour``  what an action is made of and what happens between actions:
                how many strokes, where they aim inside a control, the
                overshoot and the correction, the fidget while nothing is
                happening, the pointer creep during a scroll.  Pure: it
                returns a timeline and never touches a clock.
this module     everything with a side effect.  It decides WHEN the macro
                layer runs, walks the timeline against a real clock, keeps
                coordinates inside the viewport (a waypoint outside it is not
                merely dropped by the browser, it parks the cursor at the
                origin), and guarantees that none of the above can fail a call
                that would otherwise have succeeded.

``_motion`` is an optional dependency and its absence is survivable: without
it a session hands the job back to the browser's own expansion and says so.
``_behaviour`` is not optional - it decides where an action aims - so it is
imported plainly. It is pure stdlib and in this same package, so an install in
which it fails to import is an install in which nothing else works either.

WHEN THE MACRO LAYER RUNS - AND WHY IT IS NOT A BACKGROUND TASK
----------------------------------------------------------------
The honest way to make a pointer move while the caller's script is doing
nothing would be a background task dispatching pointer events on its own.  We
do not do that, deliberately.  The caller's script is single-threaded by
assumption; a second writer on the same page would interleave a ``mousemove``
into the middle of somebody's ``click`` - precisely the hit-target failure
described under HOVER - and it would keep sending input to a page whose script
believes nothing is touching it.  A stealth feature that intermittently breaks
clicks is not a stealth feature.

So every event this module sends is sent from inside a call the user made, and
the macro layer is folded into the head of the NEXT action instead:

* the wall clock since the last dispatch is real, and it is the input the idle
  planner wants.  We plan the whole of that idle period, then dispatch only
  the tail of it that fits the movement budget (:func:`_behaviour.tail_within`).
  What reaches the wire is therefore the last fraction of a second of a
  fidget that is planned as if it had been running all along;
* the approach to a control is planned by :func:`_behaviour.plan_approach`, so
  an action is one to three submovements with a dwell between them, ending on
  a point inside the element that is not its centre;
* ``mouse.wheel`` becomes a burst of detents with the pointer creeping between
  them, which is what a hand on a wheel does.

The whole of it is bounded by ``humanize=<seconds>``: one action never spends
more than that budget in motion, and the budget is enforced by DROPPING
waypoints, never by emitting them faster than a device could report them.
