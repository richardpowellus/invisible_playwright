"""`strict` refuses an ambiguous selector, `force` skips the checks.

⛔ THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR, and it is the same shape as `trial` one
layer along. Both options are accepted across the public API and neither
reached `_juggler/`: the server read `params.get("trial")` and nothing else, so
`strict` and `force` fell off the wire.

`strict` is the expensive one, because nobody passes it by hand. Every Locator
method sends `strict=True` - 28 call sites in `_pw/_impl/_locator.py` - so
`page.locator("button").click()` on a page with two buttons clicked the FIRST
one instead of refusing. Not a missing error message: the automation acted on
an element nobody had chosen, and said nothing.

`force` promised to "bypass the actionability checks" and bypassed none of
them. Both halves are needed for that promise - the state checks AND the hit
target - because "receives events" is one of the checks it names, and an
overlay intercepting the pointer is the ordinary reason somebody passes it.

The fix is one reader (`_act_opts`), not one reader per option: seven copies of
`params.get(...)` is how the eighth action gets written without one, which is
exactly how these two came to be accepted everywhere and read nowhere. The
structural test below is the one that keeps that true.
