"""A click has a duration, and a double click has an interval.

⛔ WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE. `mousedown` and `mouseup` left together, so what
a page measured as the hold was one protocol round trip. And the two presses of
a double click had nothing between them either - delivered as a `dblclick`
regardless, because that event is born from `clickCount` and not from the
interval, so the page saw a double click no operating system would have accepted
as one.

It is the same class the keyboard had, one device over: a press with no
duration is a press no hand made.
