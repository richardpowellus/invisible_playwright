"""`goto` / `reload` / `go_back` answer with a Response, not with None.

**Why this file exists.** Until 2026-09-08 `op_goto` ended with a hardcoded
`return {"response": None}` ([B200]). Nothing in this project noticed for a
month, and the reason is worth keeping: every probe, every gate and almost
every test in the suite writes `page.goto(url)` and throws the answer away, so
a defect that lives ENTIRELY in a return value had no assertion anywhere near
it. The network layer underneath was correct the whole time - the `response`
events, their statuses and `expect_response` all worked - which is why the
browser looked healthy while Crawlee, which reads what `goto` returns and
treats a None as a failed load, failed every single request.

The lesson generalises past this bug: a value nobody reads is a value nobody
tests. These tests read it.

**The two halves.** The unit half feeds the server the network events a real
navigation produces, in the order the engine sends them, and asks the page for
the response afterwards - which is where the two traps live: `_requests` is
emptied on `requestFinished`, so by the time `goto` stops waiting for `load`
the document request is no longer in flight, and a redirect chain gives every
hop the SAME navigationId, so the answer has to be the last one. The e2e half
drives a real browser at a local server and reads `.status`.

Known-bad inputs, each run against this file before it was trusted:

* the previous `return {"response": None}` in `op_goto` -> the goto tests go
  red, unit and e2e;
* the same in `_history` -> the reload / go_back tests go red;
* indexing the navigation by plain assignment instead of re-insertion -> the
  eviction test goes red, because a redirect chain ages at its first hop;
* returning the FIRST hop of a redirect instead of the last -> the redirect
  tests go red on both halves.
