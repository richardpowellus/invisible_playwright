"""`browser.new_page()` must give the same context as `browser.new_context()`.

The wrapper installs the profile's viewport, screen, DPR, colour scheme, locale
and timezone as defaults on `browser.new_context`. `new_page` did not go through
it, and `new_page` is the call in this package's README, in the class docstring
and in every example:

    with InvisiblePlaywright(seed=42) as browser:
        page = browser.new_page()

Playwright's `Browser.new_page` forwards to the IMPLEMENTATION object, whose own
`new_page` does `context = await self.new_context(**params)` - itself, the impl -
so a wrapper installed on the api object is never consulted. The page came up
with Playwright's stock 1280x720 viewport, the host's colour scheme and no locale
or timezone override, while the fingerprint claimed the profile's screen. A
viewport that contradicts `screen.width` is not a missing feature; it is the kind
of internal inconsistency this package exists to remove.

The e2e test at the bottom is the one that proves it in a browser. The unit tests
above it are what keeps CI honest without one.
