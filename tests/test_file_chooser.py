"""The file-chooser dialog gets intercepted, and the NATIVE one never opens.

WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. This is the most silent failure class the project has
seen: the whole JS/Juggler chain existed and was wired up correctly - the
`Page.setInterceptFileChooserDialog` command, the `Page.fileChooserOpened`
event, the flag on the docShell, the observer in PageAgent.js - but the last
native link was MISSING. The flag was written and nobody read it (the comment
in `nsDocShell.cpp` said so: "storage only"), and the observer PageAgent was
listening for, `juggler-file-picker-shown`, appeared in the whole tree only on
the line that listened for it: nobody ever fired it.

The result: `expect_file_chooser()` hung until timeout while a real Windows
"Open File" window actually popped open, stealing focus from the operating
system - while the package's public docs promise in writing the opposite
("The native OS window never appears on screen"). No test in the suite
covered it: the only ones that touch it are Microsoft's upstream tests, which
live in `tests/playwright-upstream/`, a folder excluded from pytest.

⛔ THE THIRD TEST IS THE CONTROL AND MUST NOT BE REMOVED. Suppressing the
native dialog is easy; suppressing it ONLY when automation asked for it is the
point. Without the control, this file would stay green even if we had broken
file inputs for everyone - which is exactly how a defect gets "fixed" by
making the product worse.
