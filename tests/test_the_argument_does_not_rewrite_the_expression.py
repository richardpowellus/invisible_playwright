"""The caller's JavaScript reaches the page as the caller wrote it.

⛔ THE ARGUMENT'S PLACEHOLDER WAS SEARCHED FOR INSIDE THE CALLER'S OWN CODE.
The wrapper spelled the argument `r(ARG)` and the caller substituted it
afterwards with `.replace("ARG", ...)` - over a string that already held the
caller's expression. So every uppercase `ARG` anybody wrote was rewritten to
the argument's JSON, inside their own script, with nothing said.

Measured on 2026-09-14 by driving a real browser through the MCP server:

    'CARGO'.length            ran as  'CnullO'.length   and answered 6, not 5
    [data-role='TARGET']      ran as  [data-role='TnullET']  and matched nothing
    /ARGH/                    ran as  /nullH/
    const ARG = 5             ran as  const null = 5    and was a SyntaxError

Three of those four are SILENT, which is the bad kind: no error, no warning,
just a wrong answer that a caller builds its next decision on. The three
letters only have to appear inside a longer word, so MARGIN, LARGE and CHARGE
are all affected.

⛔ AND THE FIRST TEST HERE IS NOT ABOUT THE DEFECT. `op_evaluate` runs in the
MAIN world, as the page, which is the one place in this file that deliberately
leaves the utility world. That makes the emitted script something a site can
look at, so a change to its SHAPE is a stealth change even when it is a
correctness fix. The script is pinned byte for byte against what shipped
before: for an expression that never spelled the placeholder, this fix must
produce exactly the same characters, and that is what the first test proves.
