"""Hidden-desktop guard (e2e): ``headless=True`` on Windows keeps the real
rendering pipeline and puts the whole browser tree on a Win32 desktop nobody
looks at.

Three things are asserted, and the first is a CONTROL: a headed session must
show up on the interactive desktop, or an enumeration that finds nothing on it
proves nothing. Then the hidden session must be absent from that desktop and
present on its own, and must still render (a non-blank screenshot and a live
WebGL context: Playwright's native headless has neither the window nor the
context).

Linux is skipped - there the wrapper hides through Xvfb, and the Linux e2e
runs under ``xvfb-run`` which is that path end to end.

This replaces ``test_cloak.py`` (2026-06-11 to 2026-09-20), which asserted a
DWMWA_CLOAK attribute the binary set on its own window. The engine is stock on
that surface now; what hides the window is WHERE it is created.
