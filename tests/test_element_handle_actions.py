"""Acting through an ElementHandle, not through a selector.

`page.query_selector("#go").click()` is ordinary Playwright, and until 0.10.0 it
answered "ElementHandle has no method 'click'". The client offers fifty-five
methods on a handle and the driver served fourteen, every one of them a READ:
the whole acting half was missing, and the error said so honestly while being
useless. Nine actions are wired now, and the tests below are in two layers
because the defect that was found while writing them lives in only one of them.

The lower layer checks that `Actions._retry` treats a caller's element
differently from a selector it resolved itself - it must not look the node up
again, and it must not dispose it. No browser.

The upper layer drives a real page through the PUBLIC API, which is the only
layer that exercises the dispatcher and the wire names. That distinction is not
theoretical: while this was being written, `click` and `fill` accepted the new
parameter and quietly failed to forward it, so the driver went back to querying a
selector. Every lower-layer assertion would still have passed.

⛔ AND THE ACTIONS GO THROUGH THE SAME PATH AS THE SELECTOR VERSIONS. A handle
click is the humanised pointer - approach, hover, press, release, with the
hit-target interceptor - and not a shortcut. Two click paths would be two
fingerprints, which is the one thing this package exists not to have. The e2e
below asserts the hover arrives before the click, and that the click is trusted,
because those are what a shortcut would lose.
