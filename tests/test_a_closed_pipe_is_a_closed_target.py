"""The browser being gone is one fact, and it reaches a caller as one type.

Until 0.15.0 a disposed object raised `TargetClosedError` from the dispatcher
while a closed pipe came out of the connection as a nameless error, which the
client turned into the fork's plain `Error` with `the pipe closed` in it. A
caller that had to tell "the page refused" from "the browser died" was left
matching sentences. Measured 2026-09-14 on the AIHawk server's retry.

No browser starts here: the connection is built on an `os.pipe()` pair and
the browser's end is closed by the test.

Known-bad, run before this file was trusted: drop the `name` from the box
the reader leaves for a waiter (the first test goes red); raise
`ProtocolError` again on a pipe that is already closed (the second goes
red); leave the dispatcher with a class of its own (the third goes red);
export nothing from `async_api` (the fourth goes red).
