"""The browser's stdout and stderr are read for the whole life of the process.

The known-bad input of [B229], measured on 2026-09-25: the pipe was read only
until the readiness line, so once Firefox had written a pipe buffer's worth
after startup its next write blocked, and the browser froze without an error.
Forced with `devtools.console.stdout.content`: 2 KB logged, the page answered;
8 KB logged, it never answered again, 5085 bytes sitting unread.

The unit half needs no browser: a writer on a real OS pipe stands in for
Firefox, and a pipe blocks the same way whoever writes to it.
