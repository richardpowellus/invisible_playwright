"""What the launcher tells the engine client about the SESSION, and how.

⛔ THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. The engine client has no session: it is built by a
transport that knows nothing about one. Two facts have to reach it anyway - the
seed its rhythms are drawn from, and the budget one movement may spend - or each
becomes a constant shared by every install, which is the linkage key
`19-cursor-signature.md` is about.

⛔ AND THE TWO SHAPES THAT WERE REJECTED for the seed, written down because both
look reasonable and both are wrong. A module-level value is wrong the moment one
process holds two sessions: the second would type with the first's hand. And
deriving it from `zoom.stealth.fpp.hw_seed`, which already travels, is wrong
because that value has about twenty possibilities, so unrelated sessions would
share a rhythm - the very thing being removed.

What is left is the pref dict: the launcher composes it in full, `op_launch`
already receives it, and the keys come back out before `user.js` is written so
no session identifier reaches the disk.
