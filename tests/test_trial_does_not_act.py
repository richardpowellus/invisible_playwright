"""`trial=True` runs the checks and performs nothing.

⛔ THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. `trial` is accepted on 31 public signatures
- click, dblclick, hover, tap, check, uncheck, set_checked and drag on Page,
Frame, Locator and ElementHandle - and the word did not appear anywhere in
`_juggler/`. It reached the wire and fell off it, so `click(trial=True)`
performed a real click.

The one place that read it made it worse rather than better: the cursor wrapper
took `trial` as a reason to skip the humanised approach, and then ran the action
anyway. A caller asking "would this work?" got a click with no pointer movement
in front of it, which is the most recognisable shape a click can have.

It is honoured in `Actions._retry` now, which is the only thing that knows what
actionable means. The alternative was to honour it inside each of the seven
actions, which is the same sentence written seven times and an eighth action
written without it.
