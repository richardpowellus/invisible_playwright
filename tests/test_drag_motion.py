"""A drag travels along a path, and the path is drawn by the one generator.

⛔ WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE, measured 2026-09-16 against a real page whose
source element was `draggable`. The whole gesture was five events:

    mousemove(A) mousedown(A) mousemove(B) mousemove(B) mouseup(B)

Three things are wrong with that and only one of them is about stealth.

* The 480-pixel journey happened in ONE event. No hand does that, and no pointer
  device reports it.
* The two events carrying it were IDENTICAL and 7 ms apart. A move event is born
  from moving, so a pair like that describes nothing at all. It was deliberate -
  one jump alone did not reliably start the drag - which is the shape of a
  workaround standing in for the missing path.
* And on a `draggable` source it did not work: Gecko started a native drag
  session off that single jump, `dispatchDragEvent` then failed with
  NS_ERROR_FAILURE, and the `mouseup` never went out - so the button stayed
  DOWN, poisoning the `buttons` field of every event after it.

All three come from the same absence, which is why they are fixed by the same
change rather than by three.

⛔ AND THE PATH IS NOT DRAWN HERE. `_motion.CursorMotion` draws it and `_pacing`
delivers it, the same two things the client's cursor uses. A second generator on
this side would be two definitions of "how a pointer moves", agreeing until one
of them was edited.
