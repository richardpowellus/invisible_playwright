"""The engine keyboard obeys a rhythm instead of emitting at pipe speed.

⛔ WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE. `press` sent `keydown` and `keyup` back to back,
so a page measured a hold of about 2.4 ms - the cost of one protocol round trip
- against the 60-120 ms a finger takes. `type` did the same per character with
nothing in between, so eight letters went by in about 40 ms instead of a second
or more. No probe is needed to collect that: a site only has to listen.
