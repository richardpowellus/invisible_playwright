"""`fill` and `type` wait the typist's pause between the focus and the first key.

⛔ WHAT IT REPLACES. Both actions focused the field and pressed the first key in
the same breath, a few milliseconds apart, which no hand does. A page that
answers the focus a moment later - a store writing its stored answer back into
the input, a formatter, a field loading its suggestions - then wrote over what
was already arriving. The MCP server measured it on a real form: "30" gone a
second after it was typed, an email keeping only its last letters. It put a
pause of its own in front of `fill`, importing private names of this package to
draw it and writing the hesitation's spread a second time. The pause now lives
in the action that types, for every caller, and the spread is one field of the
persona.

The unit half drives the shipped `fill` and `type` against an engine double on
a clock the test moves; the e2e half asks a real page whose store rewrites the
field after the focus.
