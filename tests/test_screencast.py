"""`page.screencast.start(on_frame=...)` streams JPEG frames of the WINDOW.

The engine's screencast came back with firefox-28, rebuilt on Firefox's own
window capture and with one flag of ours, `fullWindow`, that keeps the tab
strip, the address bar and the chrome-side pointer in every frame. This file
pins the server half: what the in-process Juggler server sends the engine,
what it hands the vendored client, and what it refuses.

The unit half builds a `PageDispatcher` without a browser: `conn` is a
property over `context.browser.conn`, so a fake connection that records
`send` and `post` calls is enough, and `emit` goes to the server's receiver.
Known-bad inputs, each run before this file was trusted:

* `fullWindow` dropped from the engine call -> the first test goes red;
* the ack sent with `send` instead of `post` -> the frame test goes red, and
  in a real browser it would be a deadlock on the reader thread;
* `screencastStart` put back into `perimeter.OUTSIDE` -> the perimeter test
  goes red and, one level up, the client would be refused with a reason
  written for a driver that no longer exists.

    one proves the wrapper puts a number on the wire; only a real engine can say
    the number does anything, and a lever nobody verified from inside the system
    it moves is a lever this project has been fooled by before.

    Interleaved is not possible here - a screencast is per page and the rate is
    fixed at start - so the arms are two pages of the same browser, same page
    served, same duration, and the assertion is on the RATIO rather than on
    either count: the absolute rate depends on the machine, and the claim is
    that asking for more gets more.

    Measured 2026-09-08 on this machine: 10 asked delivered 9.6-9.8 fps, 25
    asked delivered 23.8-24.0. The floor below is deliberately far from that -
    it is testing that the lever is connected, not re-measuring it.

    ⛔ THE SLOW ARM IS 2 AND NOT 5, AND THE REASON IS A RED THAT WAS ABOUT THE
    RUNNER. On 2026-09-17 this failed on CI with 25 asked delivering 22 frames
    in three seconds and 5 asked delivering 15. Read as a ratio that is a
    failure; read as rates it is the opposite. The slow arm hit its cap
    EXACTLY, 5.0 fps, which is the lever working; the fast arm got 7.3 fps,
    which is the loaded runner's ceiling and not an answer about the lever at
    all. The identical commit had been green seven minutes earlier, and a
    re-run on the same SHA was green again.

    The shape is what was wrong, not the threshold. Only ONE of the two arms is
    rate-limited; the other measures the MACHINE, so `fast > slow * 1.5` was an
    undeclared requirement that the machine deliver 7.5 fps. Asking for 2 moves
    that requirement to 3 fps, which no machine that can run a browser at all
    will miss.

    ⛔ AND THE ARM THAT DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE MACHINE WAS THE ONE NOBODY
    CHECKED. A cap only ever pushes the rate DOWN, so "asking for 2 delivers
    about 2 per second" is answerable on any machine, however slow - and it is
    the assertion that a lever quietly disconnected would fail first, because
    then the slow arm runs at the machine's maximum too. It is asserted now.
