"""A page's events from before its channel existed are delivered once, in order.

A page the site opens has usually requested and been answered its document
before its Page object exists, so the page holds its own events while it is
built and hands its Network events on once it can emit them. One that arrived
between the page subscribing and the browser's replay marking the session live
is held twice - live, and again from the browser's buffer - and the second
copy sits behind events older than it. These pin the hand-over without a
browser; the e2e file next door holds the outcome against a real one.
